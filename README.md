## `wordraw`

A small application to compute Wordle guesses, given a drawn Wordle board.

```
â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›  -->  aeros
ðŸŸ¨â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›ðŸŸ¨  -->  eloin
ðŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨  -->  earth
â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›  -->  aeros
â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›  -->  abeam
ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©  -->  honey
```

### Usage

Launch the application from the command line, with the answer word as the first argument. For instance, if the answer word is `honey`:
```
./out/a.out honey
```

Draw over a 5 Ã— 6 grid of Wordle cells (Black, Yellow, Green) using left-clicking. Words should appear on the grid: they are the guesses whose outcome is the drawn grid. If the row is unobtainable for the current answer word, the guess word is not shown.
